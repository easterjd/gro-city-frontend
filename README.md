# Gro.City Frontend
------------------------------

### ABOUT THIS PROJECT

We had the idea for this project based on how challenging it can be to grow plants in the city. Not only is the information about specific plants in the web very disperate, but often the rich information can be very-scientific and difficult for the laymen to understand. The purpose of this website is to bridge the gap between the rich scientific plant information available on the web, and the people who are most likely to be searching for plants.

With Gro.City, users are able to create planting project boards (similar to Pinterest) focused around specific topics (ex. creating a board for your balcony planter-box or window-sill). Users can then navigate to the plant search page and filter our robust database of plants by easy-to-understand plant characteristics like flower colors, blooming-season, and many more.
